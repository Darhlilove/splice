# Product Overview

**Splice** is an API schema exploration and development tool built for the Kiroween Hackathon. The project aims to create a comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger workflow tool with three core components:

1. **Schema Explorer**: Interactive API documentation viewer for OpenAPI specifications
2. **Mock Server Generator**: Automated mock API server creation from OpenAPI specs
3. **Client SDK Generator**: TypeScript SDK generation for API consumption

## Target Users

Developers working with APIs who need to:

- Visualize and understand OpenAPI specifications
- Test API endpoints without backend implementation
- Generate type-safe client libraries quickly

## Key Value Proposition

Seamless workflow from OpenAPI spec to working client code—upload spec, explore endpoints, start mock server, generate SDK, and make API calls in minutes.
